### FlightSimulatorInterface: The P&P Homecockpit Interface

FlightSimulatorInterface (**FSI**) manages the connection between your [Arduinos](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino) and Flight Simulator

Currently FSI only supports Prepar3D and the PMDG 737 NGX. However, future support for FS9/FSX and other airplanes (I'm focusing on PMDG) is planned.

## Project Goals

FSI aims to drastically decrease the required amount of work you need to make your self-built homecockpit parts pretty much Plug & Play.
